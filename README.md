# Biomass-Modeling

This repository contains 4 models:

1- A higher heating value prediction model for biomass combustion based on both proximate and ultimate analysis.

2- A lower heating value prediction model for gasification products based on biomass comosition in addition to afew operating conditions

3- A bio-oil prediction model for biomass fast pyrolysis

4- A bio-char prediction model for biomass slow pyrolysis
